# AndroidMalwareEvaluatingTools
In order to accomplish a deep antimalwares' detection algorithms analysis, we developed two different tools, both coded in Java.
The first tool, named Alan, through a simple UI, provides the application of eight different smali code transformations 
(detailed informations about these transformations can be found into the paper attached with the project). This tool contains
other two free tools (signapk, apktool) used to decompile and recompile an android application, providing the almost original 
resources of the application. The tool works on smali code, a human readable dalvik bytecode.
The aim of these transformations is hiding a malicious behaviour of an application from static malware scanning techniques.
A transformed application can be submitted on the website "virustotal.com" where it can be analyzed by 57 well-known (free and 
paid) anti-malwares. In order to work on a large malaware data-set, we developed a second tool, composed basically of code 
enabling an automatic upload of the android applications on virus-total, using his specific java API, storing every analysis 
result on a relational database. This tool provides a simple UI to select between several queries, saving results on an html file,
easily readable.
Everything is well-documented and ready to be improved for future works. Being an academic project, there are some limitations
(described into the paper), the run-time execution of the application is rarely compromised.
